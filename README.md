Arduino-Morse-Library
=====================

Arduino Library that blinks an LED. A personal exercise in creating libraries for Arduino. Following the guide at http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial.

#### General workflow
1. Start with a working *.ino sketch
2. Create a *.h file (C++ header) with definitions of everything inside the library
3. Create a *.cpp file containing the code to run
4. Create a keywords.txt file to enable color highlighting
5. Create an example.ino file which demonstrates the library
